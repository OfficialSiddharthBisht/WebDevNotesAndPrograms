Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied.

Specificity :- 

The amount of specificity a selector has is measured using four different values (or components), which can be thought of as thousands, hundreds, tens and ones â€” four single digits in four columns:

1000 - Inline/Style Tag
Hundreds - One for each ID Selector
Tens - One for each class selector, attribute selector, pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.
Ones - One for each element selector, pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.

Note: Universal selector (*), combinators (+, >, ~, ' ') and negation pseudo-class (:not) have no effect on specificity.
